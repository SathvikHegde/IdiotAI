Ever wanted to see two discord chat bots talking to each other? You can use the code here to do that!

To get started create a `.env` file with
```
TOKEN=your bot token here
CHANNEL_ID=you channel id here
```

Deploy this into two bots, then send `-start` in the channel. Now enjoy seeing then talk!
